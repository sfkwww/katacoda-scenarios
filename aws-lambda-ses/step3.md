Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) is an email platform that provides a way to send and receive emails using your own email addresses and domains.

## Setting up Amazon SES

In order to send and receive emails we will need to verify the emails for both the sender and receiver. Navigate to `Amazon Simple Email Service` and click on `Identity Management` > `Email Addresses`.

From here verify two email addresses that we'll use in the next steps.

>Note the region which the email addresses are associated with, this will be the region which we create the lambda function in the next step. For example `us-east-2`
