## Create AWS Account

Starting off you will need an AWS account with Free tier or higher in order to complete this tutorial. Go ahead and sign up at the [AWS Portal](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup).

You will be required to enter personal details and a payment method for billing to make sure you aren't a bot. You won't actually have to pay anything unless you go over the free tier limits, which you won't have to worry about in this tutorial.

Once you have created your account you can check that it is setup correctly by trying to access a service such as `Amazon Simple Email Service`, or `SES`. Simply type it in the search-bar at the top of the page and if you don't encounter an error after clicking on it you should be good to go.
